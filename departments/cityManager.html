<p>Alina T. Hudak has served Miami-Dade County for the past 35 years - making a stronger government for a better community. She brought professional administration to the County's leadership team and is an esteemed leader in the field of public administration. Winning a myriad of accolades from national and local community organizations, Hudak has been a trailblazer as the first woman Director of a large operational department, the first Hispanic woman appointed Assistant County Manager, and the first woman to serve as County Manager overseeing a government of more than 27,000 employees and an $8 billion budget.</p>
<br><p>The incredible diversity of Miami-Dade's government encompassed not only traditional municipal services such as police, fire, public works, libraries and parks, but also major regional facilities such as public housing, airports, the seaport, jails, water and sewer, and bus and rail service.</p>
<br><p>In her previous role as Deputy Mayor, Hudak oversaw a portfolio of departments that included Animal Services, Elections, Transit and Public Works, the Citizen's Independent Transportation Trust and the Public Health Trust. She also concurrently served as the Director of Solid Waste Management Department, which encompassed approximately 1,000 employees, a waste to energy plant, two landfills and provided solid waste collection and disposal services for over 350,000 residential homes in Miami-Dade County.</p>
<br><p>She led the County's nationally-recognized response to the ZIKA emergency in 2016, recognized by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as the only government to eradicate the disease transmission successfully, and the County's largest debris removal effort after Hurricane Irma.</p>
<br><p>Hudak learned Miami-Dade County from the ground up, beginning her career in the organization in 1984 as a management trainee. In 1993, she was appointed Assistant County Manager and, in 1996, was appointed Director of the General Services Administration - one of the County's largest and most complex operational functions, then composed of seven divisions and over 800 employees. In 1998, she returned to the County Manager's Office as an Assistant County Manager, where she led an extensive procurement reform effort that culminated in the creation of improved and expedited procurement legislation. She has overseen just about every portfolio of departments, including the nationally-acclaimed Police and Fire Rescue departments, the County's first stand-alone Animal Services Department and all of the Parks and Cultural components of County government. In 2011, Hudak was appointed County Manager during a transformation in leadership and governance. She managed that critical and challenging time with grace, bringing her expertise and institutional knowledge to ensure County business continuity and excellence.</p>
<br><p>Hudak joined the City of Miami Beach in February 2020 as an Assistant City Manager - overseeing a large portfolio of departments, including Capital Improvement Projects, Environment &amp; Sustainability, Housing &amp; Community Development, Marketing &amp; Communications, Public Works and Transportation &amp; Mobility.</p>
<br><p>Along with her pioneering efforts in government, Hudak has been actively involved and contributed greatly to many community organizations and causes. Among them are leading the County's Haitian Relief Effort, United Way campaigns, the Making Strides Against Breast Cancer campaign, and serving as the County's liaison for six Super Bowls and five National Championship events. She is particularly proud of her efforts over the past 16 years to create breast cancer prevention awareness and has been instrumental in turning Miami-Dade County government "pink" during the month of October. Committed to green spaces, parks and transportation corridors, Hudak is also on the Board of the Friends of The Underline, a 10-mile linear park under the Metrorail guideway.</p>
<br><p>Hudak holds a Bachelor's degree in Business Administration and a Master's degree in Public Administration, both from the University of Miami. She is a loyal and dedicated alumna having served for many years on the Alumni Association's Board of Directors and being inducted into their prestigious Order of the Iron Arrow Honor Society. Hudak and her husband are the proud parents of two daughters who share a love of public service, community and Hurricane football.</p>
