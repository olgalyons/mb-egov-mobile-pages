        <p>The City of Miami Beach Parks and Recreation Department provides a myriad of programs and services seven (7) days per week.  Our professional staff is committed to continuously improve the City's Parks and Recreation services.  The Department is composed of the Administration Division and three (3) operating Divisions: Recreation, Greenspace Management and Golf.<br>
          <br>
          <strong>Department Accomplishments</strong><br>
        In October of 2003 &amp; 2008, the Parks &amp; Recreation Department earned its accreditation from the Commission for Accreditation of Parks and Recreation Agencies (CAPRA). We have been considered to be one of less than 100 Parks and Recreation Departments across America to have earned this prestigious certification. Our department was recognized by complying with over 150 standards deemed essential to the quality of services delivered, the professionalism of its operations and for the delivery of best practices. We are proud to have been among the best recognized for our excellent services and professionalism and strive to continue providing that quality of service every day.<br>
        <br>
        Since 2008, the Recreation Division and the University of Miami-Nova Southeastern University Center for Autism and Related Disabilities (UM-NSU CARD) have and plan to continue hosting a Surf Camp for Children with Autism. The camp has been highly successful and nationally recognized. The unique curriculum focuses on swimming skills, basic oceanography, meteorology, open water surfing &amp; most importantly the children's abilities. <br>
        <br>
        In 2008, the Recreation Division completed the build-out and successfully opened the new home of the Miami Beach Teen Club at the 21st Street Recreation Center. The Teen Club, which began in 2004 at North Shore Park and Youth Center with only nine teens, now boasts more than 200 members. We have also added an additional Teen Club Program running out of Fairway Park.<br>
        <br>
        Also in 2008, the Parks &amp; Recreation Department was awarded the &quot;Agency Excellence Award&quot; by the Florida Recreation and Parks Association (FRPA). FRPA is a non-profit organization dedicated to the promotion, preservation and advocacy of the Parks, Recreation and Leisure Services profession. The &quot;Agency Excellence Award&quot; is given to parks and recreation agencies that exemplify ideal departmental initiatives, including administration, master planning, diverse programming, community partnerships and promotion of the department.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>In 2010, the Scott Rakow Youth Center opened it's doors to their newly renovated facility including a new fitness room, gymnastic room, media room, computer lab, music room, multi-purpose room, a completely renovated bowling alley, a game room and snack bar area.<br>
          <br>
        In 2013, the Recreation Division in collaboration with the University of Miami-Nova Southeastern University Center for Autism and Related Disabilities (UM-NSU CARD) successfully hired five &quot;shadows&quot; to assist those summer camp participants with Autism Spectrum Disorder. The collaboration was a success, mainstreaming children with special needs with the help of a shadow in order to maximize their summer camp experience. We hope to expand that collaboration further in the upcoming years to include our other programs as well including our After School Programs.</p>
