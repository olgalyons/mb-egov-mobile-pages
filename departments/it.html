			<li><strong>Security</strong> - The IT Department is implementing industry leading security measures.</li>
			<li><strong>Privatization</strong> - The IT Department is actively encouraging partnerships with the private sector where appropriate and cost effective. Commercially proven solutions are considered whenever equivalent services can be acquired more economically and meet the City’s requirements. The City must be willing to make changes in business procedures to gain the beneﬁts of standard commercial solutions, rather than always developing custom software to accommodate existing business practices.</li>
			<li><strong>Accessibility of Government Services </strong> - The IT Department will continue to use web-enabled technology to reduce the time and cost required for members of the workforce and community to access selected City of Miami Beach Government information and services.</li>
			<li><strong>Systems Integration </strong> - The IT Department examines possibilities for data integration whenever possible. As requirements for business information expand beyond the single user department that is the custodian of the data, it is critical that applications support data integration.

			<li><strong>Governance</strong>The IT Department empowers each department by allowing them to take an active part and “Governance” in understanding the services to be provided by the IT Department. This Governance is the process of securing user input on such issues as direction, establishing priorities, reviewing technology decisions, and providing effective user communication in systems development and daily operations. Partnerships between the exploring department and IT are necessary to assure that results of successful explorations can be realized.</li>
			<li><strong>Business Continuity </strong>The IT Department focuses on a Business Continuity Strategy to ensure technologies are streamlined without adversely affecting compliance, risk, or security.</li>
			<li><strong>Innovation </strong>The IT Department stays on the cutting edge of new technologies that can streamline operations and citizen engagement. IT also provides City departments with the tools and expertise needed to facilitate innovation ideation and execution processes.</li>
