        <p>The Planning Department prepares, administers, updates, and maintains Neighborhood, Citywide and Comprehensive plans, the Land Development Regulations of the City Code, as well as technical data for the City pursuant to Florida Statues. The Planning Department consists of four sections: Planning, Zoning, Neighborhood Planning and Urban Design &amp; Historic Preservation.<br>
          <br>
        The Planning section manages the City's comprehensive planning process and modifications to the land development regulations. This includes new codes and code amendments, as well as changes to the comprehensive plan. The Planning section also provides administrative support for the Planning Board, which is the land planning agency of the City. In addition to these areas, the Planning Board administers the Conditional Use and Neighborhood Impact Establishment processes.<br>
        <br>
        The Zoning section reviews all license applications and building plans, as part of the Building Permit process, to ensure compliance with the land development regulations. The zoning section also provides staff support to the Board of Adjustment, which includes processing and making recommendations for all variance requests and appeals of administrative decisions and code interpretations.<br>
        <br>
        The Neighborhood Planning section evaluates defined areas of the City in order to address specific neighborhood issues. This includes the establishment of overlay districts, neighborhood plans and streetscape modifications and enhancements. <br>
        <br>
        The Urban Design &amp; Historic Preservation Section examines all site and building plans to confirm that physical changes proposed to an existing site or building are consistent with the surrounding aesthetic character of the community. This section also provides technical administrative support to the Design Review Board and the Historic Preservation Board. The Historic Preservation section also prepares reports on historically significant buildings and sites, and makes recommendations to the Historic Preservation Board on requests for Certificates of Appropriateness for demolition and Historic Designation.</p>
