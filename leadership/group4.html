			<p>Born in Brooklyn, New York, Steven Meiner was raised to believe in public service and the importance of
				community. His father, Sheldon Meiner, dedicated his career to public service as a U.S. Internal Revenue
				Service agent for almost 40 years, and his mother, Dorothy Weiss, likewise dedicated her career to
				public service as a public school teacher and guidance counselor. Stevenâ€™s parents were role models of
				the importance of public service.</p>
			<br />
			<p>Steven followed in his parents footsteps and has dedicated most of his 23 year professional career as an
				attorney to public service fighting against fraud. Since 2007, when he moved to Miami Beach, Steven has
				served as a civil law enforcement attorney with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Prior
				to the SEC, Steven practiced law in New York City handling complex financial litigation cases for
				prestigious international law firms Dewey Ballantine and Mayer Brown.</p>
			<br />
			<p>Steven has been devoted to helping his community and was honored as Man of the Year by a local civic
				organization in 2012. Steven was also appointed to serve on a City of Miami Beach advisory panel and is
				also active with a number of local charitable organizations.</p>
			<br />
			<p>Steven has been married to his wife Shanyn for 18 years and they are proud parents of their two young
				children, Matisyahu and Michal.</p>
			<br />
			<p>Steven&nbsp;earned his J.D. Cum Laude from Brooklyn Law School, and graduated Summa Cum Laude with his
				B.A. from Brooklyn College with Phi Beta Kappa honors.</p>
