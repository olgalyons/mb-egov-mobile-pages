			<p>On August 14, 2012, former State Representative David Richardson made history in Florida when he became
				the first openly gay person to win a seat in the Florida Legislature. While it was his first campaign
				ever, Richardson mounted a true grassroots campaign that brought people together.</p>
			<br />
			<p>A native of Houston, Texas, Richardson moved to Florida more than 50 years ago, where he attended Lyman
				High School and later studied at the University of Central Florida, graduating with degrees in
				Accounting and Biology. After graduating from the University of Central Florida, he attended the
				University of Tampa earning his Master of Business Administration degree.</p>
			<br />
			<p>From there, he began his successful career in accounting and auditing. He first worked as an auditor for
				the U.S. Department of Defense, after which he joined Ernst and Young, an international accounting and
				consulting firm. In 1993, he opened his own small business focused on forensic auditing of government
				contracts. For the last 34 years, Richardson has been a Certified Public Accountant in the State of
				Florida.&nbsp;Since 2012, he has put his more than three decades of experience to work on behalf of the
				community he represents.</p>
			<br />
			<p>While serving in the state legislature, Richardson was a voice for the LGBT community, working tirelessly
				to end discrimination and promoting LGBT rights and equality. Richardson is also known for his
				deep-rooted commitment to government accountability and transparency and his extensive work related to
				prison reform.</p>
			<br />
			<p>Today, David is proud to have been elected to the Miami Beach City Commission where he will continue his
				dedication to public service and continue putting his more than three decades of forensic auditing
				experience to work on behalf of the residents of Miami Beach.</p>
